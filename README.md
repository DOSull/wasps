# Wasp control by gene drives
Repository for a model of wasp control by gene drive.

This work has now been published in the paper 

Lester PJ, D Oâ€™Sullivan and GLW Perry. 2023. Gene drives for invasive wasp control: Extinction is unlikely, with suppression dependent on dispersal and growth rates. _Ecological Applications_ e2912. doi: [10.1002/eap.2912](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.2912)

which has an associated open data resource that enables recreation of all figures, and includes a final version of the model code at
