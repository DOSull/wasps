```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(janitor)
```

## Read the data
And clean up all the NetLogo name weirdness

```{r}
wasps <- read.csv(
  "wasps GRID-RELEASE-EXPERIMENT-table.csv", skip = 6) %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  rename(run_number = x_run_number, t = x_step) %>%
  mutate(total_wild = total_pop - total_gm - total_sterile) %>%
  arrange(sample(seq_len(nrow(.)), nrow(.)))
```

Quick look at all the data as time series.

```{r}
ggplot(wasps %>% 
         arrange(run_number) %>% 
         filter(grid_resolution == 1, spatial_or_temporal == "temporal")) +
  geom_line(aes(x = t, y = total_pop, colour = as.factor(program_duration),
                group = run_number), alpha = 0.15) +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  facet_grid(periodicity ~ colonies_per_site, scales = "free",
             labeller = labeller(.rows = label_both, .cols = label_both))
```
